  author={Lee, Jeongjin and Cooley, Daniel},
  abstract={We consider the problem of performing prediction when observed values are at their highest levels. We construct an inner product space of nonnegative random variables from transformed-linear combinations of independent regularly varying random variables. The matrix of inner products corresponds to the tail pairwise dependence matrix, which summarizes tail dependence. The projection theorem yields the optimal transformed-linear predictor, which has the same form as the best linear unbiased predictor in non-extreme prediction. We also construct prediction intervals based on the geometry of regular variation. We show that these intervals have good coverage in a simulation study as well as in two applications; prediction of high pollution levels, and prediction of large financial losses.},

  title={Partial Tail Correlation for Extremes},

  author={Lee, Jeongjin and Cooley, Daniel},
  abstract={We develop a method for investigating conditional extremal relationships between variables at their extreme levels. We consider an inner product space constructed from transformed-linear combinations of independent regularly varying random variables. By developing the projection theorem for the inner product space, we derive the concept of partial tail correlation via projection theorem. We show that the partial tail correlation can be understood as the inner product of the prediction errors associated with the best transformed-linear prediction. Similar to Gaussian cases, we connect partial tail correlation to the inverse of the inner product matrix and show that a zero in this inverse implies a partial tail correlation of zero. We develop a hypothesis test for the partial tail correlation of zero and demonstrate the performance in a simulation study as well as in two applications: high nitrogen dioxide levels in Washington DC and extreme river discharges in the upper Danube basin.},

  title={X-Vine Models for Multivariate Extremes},
  bibtex_show={true},
  author={Kiriliouk, Anna and Lee, Jeongjin and Segers, Johan},
  abstract={Regular vine sequences permit the organisation of variables in a random vector along a sequence of trees. Regular vine models have become greatly popular in dependence modelling as a way to combine arbitrary bivariate copulas into higher-dimensional ones, offering flexibility, parsimony, and tractability. In this project, we use regular vine structures to decompose and construct the exponent measure density of a multivariate extreme value distribution, or, equivalently, the tail copula density. Although these densities pose theoretical challenges due to their infinite mass, their homogeneity property offers simplifications. The theory sheds new light on existing parametric families and facilitates the construction of new ones, called X-vines. Computations proceed via recursive formulas in terms of bivariate model components. We develop simulation algorithms for X-vine multivariate Pareto distributions as well as methods for parameter estimation and model selection on the basis of threshold exceedances. The methods are illustrated by Monte Carlo experiments and a case study on US flight delay data.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
